# SOLID Principles Analysis for packages/cli/src/types

## Current Organization Assessment

### Strengths ✅

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each file has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Core data models are well-separated by concern (analysis, exports, source, dependencies)
   - Service interfaces are logically grouped (analyzers, extractors, validators)
   - Result types are separated by operation type (validation, type-checking)

2. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Services are properly segregated:
     - `FileAnalyzer` vs `ProjectAnalyzer` (different scopes)
     - `ExportExtractor` vs `TypeChecker` (different responsibilities)
   - Clients only depend on interfaces they actually use

3. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Interface-based design allows for extension without modification
   - Service contracts are stable and extensible

### Issues Identified ❌

1. **Inconsistent Service Interface Organization**
   - Service interfaces are scattered across:
     - Root level: `package.ts`, `processing.ts`, `infrastructure.ts`
     - Dedicated directory: `services/`
   - This violates consistent organization principles

2. **Mixed Concerns in Root Files**
   - Root files contain both data models and service interfaces
   - Example: `package.ts` has `PackageInfo` (data model) + `PackageManager` (service interface)

## Proposed Reorganization

### Option 1: Move All Service Interfaces to services/

```
types/
├── core/           # Data models only
├── enums/          # Enumerations only
├── results/        # Result types only
├── services/       # ALL service interfaces
│   ├── analyzers.ts
│   ├── extractors.ts
│   ├── validators.ts
│   ├── package-management.ts    # From package.ts
│   ├── file-processing.ts       # From processing.ts
│   └── infrastructure.ts        # From infrastructure.ts
└── models/         # Data models from root files
    └── package.ts  # PackageInfo only
```

### Option 2: Create Clear Separation by Type

```
types/
├── models/         # ALL data models
│   ├── core/       # Core analysis models
│   ├── package.ts  # Package data models
│   └── results/    # Result data models
├── services/       # ALL service interfaces
│   ├── analyzers.ts
│   ├── extractors.ts
│   ├── validators.ts
│   ├── package-management.ts
│   ├── file-processing.ts
│   └── infrastructure.ts
└── enums/          # Enumerations
```

## Recommended Solution: Option 1

**Rationale:**

- Maintains current well-organized core/ structure
- Consolidates all service interfaces in one place
- Minimal disruption to existing imports
- Clear separation of concerns

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Better adherence to SRP (single file type per directory)
- ✅ Improved discoverability (all services in one place)
- ✅ Consistent organization pattern
- ✅ Easier maintenance and extension

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Move service interfaces from root files to services/
2. Keep data models in appropriate locations
3. Update index.ts re-exports
4. Update import paths throughout codebase
